Here are some instructions on how to produce plots
for the tabu search homework asssigment via Splus.

(1). Create a file of your output results from TS.
     For example,  if you compile with 
 
	g++ -g -Wall tabu.c rngs.c

     then a.out is created.  Instead of routing the
     output to the screen by entering `a.out' route
     the output to a file pmed.out by `a.out > pmed.out'.

(2). Strip off all introductory and summary information
     in pmed.out.  The final format of pmed.out should 
     look like

  1      979.835      979.835      0        0
  2      937.177      937.177      0        0
  3      900.587      900.587      0        0


(3). Now your ready to use Splus.  Enter `Splus' (do
     not try to run it in the background with &). 
     Eventually you will see a `>' prompt.  Enter

> pmed.list <- scan("pmed.out",what=list(itr=0,obj=0,best=0,tabu=0,asp=0))

     This makes the data available to Splus.  Next enter

> plot(pmed.list$itr,pmed.list$obj,type="l",xlim=c(1,150),ylim=c(760,1000))
or 
> plot(splus.list$itr,splus.list$obj,type="l",xlim=c(0,500),ylim=c(250,1250))

      This will plot all of the data points in pmed.out.  If you don't
      want all the points plotted you can adjust xlim to start somewhere
      other than iteration 1.  For example `xlim=c(25,150)' plots 
      iterations 25 to 150.  (Note: you will get warning messages printed
      to the screen for the values you have ignored, but this is ok.)
      ylim adjusts the vertical axis range values if you use the 25 to 150
      iterations then the range for ylim can be smaller say 760 to 780.

(4). Now you are ready to print out the plot that appears in the motif 
     window.  To do this, first make sure the printing options are 
     correct. Click on OPTIONS and then on PRINTING...  In the command
     line you should have `lpr -Php113'.  If you don't enter it.  Click
     on SAVE and then CLOSE.  Now you are really ready to print.  Click 
     on GRAPH and then on PRINT.  Your plot should appear on the printer
     in Jones 113.



Good luck.....
